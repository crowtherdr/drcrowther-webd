This and other homeland teams were announced early in 2021 and volunteers were requested to staff the teams. I was happy on the Family Tree Team, however, I don't like to hear crickets chirping when someone asks for volunteers, so I volunteered. And, here I am. I was surprised at the diversity of just language in this area. I knew about Spanish and Portuguese. However, there is also, French, Dutch, Italian, and others. We are focusing on SEO for ES, FR, IT, and PT; better search experiences for this region (which benefits all the world), and LA cultural celebrations like DÃ­a de los Muertos.",

        "description": "My time on the FamilySearch Family Tree Team was about working on parts of web apps rather than entire web pages. I also served for a time as a team lead which involved building up the team and helping team members be successful. Working on app parts and being a team lead resulted in not having one entire page example to show and most of the pages require an account (it's free) to see them. The best page I could think of is the Family Tree Overview page even though I DID NOT work on that page. It does provide a good explanation of the Family Tree. Regarding my work as a team lead I subscribe to <a href='https://www.manager-tools.com/'>Manager Tools</a> and regularly listen to its podcasts. I believe in giving feedback, one-on-ones, regular results discussions, and regular reviews.",

FamilySearch just started a web development group as well. This team was responsible for brochure pages and this fit my strengths of coding in HTML and CSS with a touch of JavaScript.
